A Travel App UI Design in Flutter.

Main goal here is to learn how to use Flutter widgets to build complex responsive/adaptive UI designs.

All of the data used is just a dummy data so, do not pay attention to the content of the app.

Design inspiration comes from <a href="https://dribbble.com/imran_ux">Dribbble</a>.
